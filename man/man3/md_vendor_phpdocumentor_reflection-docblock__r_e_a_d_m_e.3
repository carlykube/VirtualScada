.SS "Usage "
.PP
The ReflectionDocBlock component is designed to work in an identical fashion to \fBPHP\fP's own Reflection extension (http://php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php)\&.
.PP
Parsing can be initiated by instantiating the \fC\\\fBphpDocumentor\fP\\Reflection\\DocBlock()\fP class and passing it a string containing a DocBlock (including asterisks) or by passing an object supporting the \fCgetDocComment()\fP method\&.
.PP
.RS 4
\fIExamples of objects having the \fCgetDocComment()\fP method are the \fCReflectionClass\fP and the \fCReflectionMethod\fP classes of the \fBPHP\fP Reflection extension\fP
