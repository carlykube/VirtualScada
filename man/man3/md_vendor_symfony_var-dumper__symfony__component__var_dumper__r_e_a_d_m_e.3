md_vendor_symfony_var-dumper__symfony__component__var_dumper__r_e_a_d_m_e \- \fBSymfony\fP mechanism for exploring and dumping \fBPHP\fP variables 
This component provides a mechanism that allows exploring then dumping any \fBPHP\fP variable\&.
.PP
It handles scalars, objects and resources properly, taking hard and soft references into account\&. More than being immune to infinite recursion problems, it allows dumping where references link to each other\&. It explores recursive structures using a breadth-first algorithm\&.
.PP
The component exposes all the parts involved in the different steps of cloning then dumping a \fBPHP\fP variable, while applying size limits and having specialized output formats and methods\&.
