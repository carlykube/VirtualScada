Sampling handler
.PP
\fBA\fP sampled event stream can be useful for logging high frequency events in a production environment where you only need an idea of what is happening and are not concerned with capturing every occurrence\&. Since the decision to handle or not handle a particular event is determined randomly, the resulting sampled log is not guaranteed to contain 1/N of the events that occurred in the application, but based on the Law of large numbers, it will tend to be close to this ratio with a large number of attempts\&.
