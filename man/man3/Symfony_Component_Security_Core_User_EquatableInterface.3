.SS "isEqualTo (\fBUserInterface\fP $user)"
The equality comparison should neither be done by referential equality nor by comparing identities (i\&.e\&. getId() === getId())\&.
.PP
However, you do not need to compare every attribute, but only those that are relevant for assessing whether re-authentication is required\&.
.PP
Also implementation should consider that $user instance may implement the extended user interface \fC\fBAdvancedUserInterface\fP\fP\&.
