.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Test should cover all languages mentioned on http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/l10n/pluralforms and Plural forms mentioned on http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Plural-forms\&.
.PP
See also https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localization_and_Plurals which mentions 15 rules having a maximum of 6 forms\&. The mozilla code is also interesting to check for\&.
.PP
As mentioned by chx http://drupal.org/node/1273968 we can cover all by testing number from 0 to 199
.PP
The goal to cover all languages is to far fetched so this test case is smaller\&.

.SS "failingLangcodes ()"
This array should be at least empty within the near future\&.

This both depends on a complete list trying to add above as understanding the plural rules of the current failing languages\&.

\fBReturns:\fP

.SS "successLangcodes ()"
This array should contain all currently known langcodes\&.

As it is impossible to have this ever complete we should try as hard as possible to have it almost complete\&.
