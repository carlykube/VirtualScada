Send the given Message\&.
.PP
Recipient/sender data will be retrieved from the Message API\&.
.PP
The return value is the number of recipients who were accepted for delivery\&. NOTE: If using 'sendmail -t' you will not be aware of any failures until they bounce (i\&.e\&. \fBsend()\fP will always return 100% success)\&.

.SS "setCommand ( $command)"
Set the command to invoke\&.
.PP
If using -t mode you are strongly advised to include -oi or -i in the flags\&. For example: /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -t \fBSwift\fP will append a -f<sender> flag if one is not present\&.
.PP
The recommended mode is '-bs' since it is interactive and failure notifications are hence possible\&.
