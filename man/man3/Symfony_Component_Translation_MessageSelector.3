.SS "choose ( $message,  $number,  $locale)"
Given a message with different plural translations separated by a pipe (|), this method returns the correct portion of the message based on the given number, locale and the pluralization rules in the message itself\&.
.PP
The message supports two different types of pluralization rules:
.PP
interval: {0} There are no apples|{1} There is one apple|]1,Inf] There are count% apples indexed: There is one apple|There are count% apples
.PP
The indexed solution can also contain labels (e\&.g\&. one: There is one apple)\&. This is purely for making the translations more clear - it does not affect the functionality\&.
.PP
The two methods can also be mixed: {0} There are no apples|one: There is one apple|more: There are count% apples
