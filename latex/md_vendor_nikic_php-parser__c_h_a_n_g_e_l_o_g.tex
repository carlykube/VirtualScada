\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily Name\+Resolver} now resolves parameter type hints when entering the function/method/closure node. As such other visitors running after it will be able to make use of the resolved names at that point already.
\item The autoloader no longer sets the {\ttfamily unserialize\+\_\+callback\+\_\+func} ini option on registration -\/ this is not necessary and may cause issues when running Php\+Unit tests with process isolation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{\doxyref{Version}{p.}{namespace_version} 1.\+2.\+1 (2015-\/03-\/24) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed registration of the aliases introduced in 1.\+2.\+0. Previously the old class names could not be used in {\ttfamily instanceof} checks under some circumstances.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{\doxyref{Version}{p.}{namespace_version} 1.\+2.\+0 (2015-\/03-\/22) }

\subsubsection*{Changed}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To ensure compatibility with \doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 7, the following node classes have been renamed\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  OLD                             => NEW
  PhpParser\Node\Expr\Cast\Bool   => PhpParser\Node\Expr\Cast\Bool_
  PhpParser\Node\Expr\Cast\Int    => PhpParser\Node\Expr\Cast\Int_
  PhpParser\Node\Expr\Cast\Object => PhpParser\Node\Expr\Cast\Object_
  PhpParser\Node\Expr\Cast\String => PhpParser\Node\Expr\Cast\String_
  PhpParser\Node\Scalar\String    => PhpParser\Node\Scalar\String_
\end{DoxyVerb}


{\bfseries The previous class names are still supported as aliases.} However it is strongly encouraged to use the new names in order to make your code compatible with \doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 7.
\item Subnodes are now stored using real properties instead of an array. This improves performance and memory usage of the initial parse and subsequent node tree operations. The {\ttfamily Node\+Abstract} class still supports the old way of specifying subnodes, however this is {\itshape deprecated}. In any case properties that are assigned to a node after creation will no longer be considered as subnodes.
\item Methods and property declarations will no longer set the {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Class\+\_\+\+::\+M\+O\+D\+I\+F\+I\+E\+R\+\_\+\+P\+U\+B\+L\+I\+C} flag if no visibility is explicitly given. However the {\ttfamily is\+Public()} method will continue to return true. This allows you to distinguish whether a method/property is explicitly or implicitly public and control the pretty printer output more precisely.
\item The {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Class\+\_\+}, {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Interface\+\_\+} and {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Trait\+\_\+} nodes now inherit from {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Class\+Like}, which provides a {\ttfamily get\+Methods()} method. Previously this method was only available on {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Class\+\_\+}.
\item Support including the {\ttfamily bootstrap.\+php} file multiple times.
\item Make documentation and tests part of the release tarball again.
\item Improve support for H\+H\+V\+M and \doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 7.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Added}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for \doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 7 return type declarations. This adds an additional {\ttfamily return\+Type} subnode to {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Function\+\_\+}, {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Class\+Method} and {\ttfamily Expr\textbackslash{}Closure}.
\item Added support for the \doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 7 null coalesce operator {\ttfamily ??}. The operator is represented by {\ttfamily Expr\textbackslash{}Binary\+Op\textbackslash{}Coalesce}.
\item Added support for the \doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 7 spaceship operator {\ttfamily $<$=$>$}. The operator is represented by {\ttfamily Expr\textbackslash{}Binary\+Op\textbackslash{}Spaceship}.
\item Added use builder.
\item Added global namespace support to the namespace builder.
\item Added a constructor flag to {\ttfamily Node\+Traverser}, which disables cloning of nodes.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{\doxyref{Version}{p.}{namespace_version} 1.\+1.\+0 (2015-\/01-\/18) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Methods that do not specify an explicit visibility (e.\+g. {\ttfamily function method()}) will now have the {\ttfamily M\+O\+D\+I\+F\+I\+E\+R\+\_\+\+P\+U\+B\+L\+I\+C} flag set. This also means that their {\ttfamily is\+Public()} method will return true.
\item Declaring a property as abstract or final is now an error.
\item The {\ttfamily Lexer} and {\ttfamily Lexer\textbackslash{}Emulative} classes now accept an {\ttfamily \$options} array in their constructors. Currently only the {\ttfamily used\+Attributes} option is supported, which determines which attributes will be added to A\+S\+T nodes. In particular it is now possible to add information on the token and file positions corresponding to a node. For more details see the https\+://github.com/nikic/\+P\+H\+P-\/\+Parser/blob/master/doc/component/\+Lexer.\+markdown \char`\"{}\+Lexer component\char`\"{} documentation.
\item Node visitors can now return {\ttfamily Node\+Traverser\+::\+D\+O\+N\+T\+\_\+\+T\+R\+A\+V\+E\+R\+S\+E\+\_\+\+C\+H\+I\+L\+D\+R\+E\+N} from {\ttfamily enter\+Node()} in order to skip all children of the current node, for all visitors.
\item Added builders for traits and namespaces.
\item The class, interface, trait, function, method and property builders now support adding doc comments using the {\ttfamily set\+Doc\+Comment()} method.
\item Added support for fully-\/qualified and namespace-\/relative names in builders. No longer allow use of name component arrays.
\item Do not add documentation and tests to distribution archive files.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{\doxyref{Version}{p.}{namespace_version} 1.\+0.\+2 (2014-\/11-\/04) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily Name\+Resolver} visitor now also resolves names in trait adaptations (aliases and precedence declarations).
\item Remove stray whitespace when pretty-\/printing trait adaptations that only change visibility.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{\doxyref{Version}{p.}{namespace_version} 1.\+0.\+1 (2014-\/10-\/14) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Disallow {\ttfamily new} expressions without a class name. Previously {\ttfamily new;} was accidentally considered to be valid code.
\item Support T\+\_\+\+O\+N\+U\+M\+B\+E\+R token used by H\+H\+V\+M.
\item Add ability to directly pass code to the {\ttfamily \doxyref{php-\/parse.\+php}{p.}{php-parse_8php}} script.
\item Prevent truncation of {\ttfamily var\+\_\+dump()} output in the {\ttfamily \doxyref{php-\/parse.\+php}{p.}{php-parse_8php}} script if X\+Debug is used.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{\doxyref{Version}{p.}{namespace_version} 1.\+0.\+0 (2014-\/09-\/12) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item [B\+C] Removed deprecated {\ttfamily \doxyref{Template}{p.}{namespace_template}} and {\ttfamily Template\+Loader} classes.
\item Fixed X\+M\+L unserializer to properly work with new namespaced node names.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{\doxyref{Version}{p.}{namespace_version} 1.\+0.\+0-\/beta2 (2014-\/08-\/31) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item [\doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 5.\+6] Updated support for constant scalar expressions to comply with latest changes. This means that arrays and array dimension fetches are now supported as well.
\item [\doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 5.\+6] Direct array dereferencing of constants is supported now, i.\+e. both {\ttfamily F\+O\+O[0]} and {\ttfamily Foo\+::\+B\+A\+R[0]} are valid now.
\item Fixed handling of special class names ({\ttfamily self}, {\ttfamily parent} and {\ttfamily static}) in the name resolver to be case insensitive. Additionally the name resolver now enforces that special class names are only used as unqualified names, e.\+g. {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}self} is considered invalid.
\item The case of references to the {\ttfamily static} class name is now preserved. Previously {\ttfamily static} was always lowercased, regardless of the case used in the source code.
\item The autoloader now only requires a file if it exists. This allows usages like `class\+\_\+exists(\textquotesingle{}\doxyref{Php\+Parser}{p.}{namespace_php_parser}\textquotesingle{})`.
\item Added experimental {\ttfamily \doxyref{bin/php-\/parse.\+php}{p.}{php-parse_8php}} script, which is intended to help exploring and debugging the node tree.
\item Separated the parser implemention (in {\ttfamily \doxyref{lib/\+Php\+Parser/\+Parser\+Abstract.\+php}{p.}{_parser_abstract_8php}}) and the generated data (in {\ttfamily \doxyref{lib/\+Php\+Parser/\+Parser.\+php}{p.}{nikic_2php-parser_2lib_2_php_parser_2_parser_8php}}). Furthermore the parser now uses meaningful variable names and contains comments explaining their usage.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{\doxyref{Version}{p.}{namespace_version} 1.\+0.\+0-\/beta1 (2014-\/03-\/27) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item [B\+C] P\+H\+P-\/\+Parser now requires \doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 5.\+3 or newer to run. It is however still possible to {\itshape parse} \doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 5.\+2 source code, while running on a newer version.
\item [B\+C] The library has been moved to use namespaces with the {\ttfamily \doxyref{Php\+Parser}{p.}{namespace_php_parser}} vendor prefix. However, the old names using underscores are still available as aliases, as such most code should continue running on the new version without further changes.

However, code performing dispatch operations on {\ttfamily Node\+::get\+Type()} may be affected by some of the name changes. For example a {\ttfamily +} node will now return type {\ttfamily Expr\+\_\+\+Binary\+Op\+\_\+\+Plus} instead of {\ttfamily Expr\+\_\+\+Plus}. In particular this may affect custom pretty printers.

Due to conflicts with reserved keywords, some class names now end with an underscore, e.\+g. {\ttfamily P\+H\+P\+Parser\+\_\+\+Node\+\_\+\+Stmt\+\_\+\+Class} is now {\ttfamily \doxyref{Php\+Parser}{p.}{namespace_php_parser}\textbackslash{}Node\textbackslash{}Stmt\textbackslash{}Class\+\_\+}. (But as usual, the old name is still available)
\item [\doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 5.\+6] Added support for the power operator {\ttfamily $\ast$$\ast$} (node {\ttfamily Expr\textbackslash{}Binary\+Op\textbackslash{}Pow}) and the compound power assignment operator {\ttfamily $\ast$$\ast$=} (node {\ttfamily Expr\textbackslash{}Assign\+Op\textbackslash{}Pow}).
\item [\doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 5.\+6] Added support for variadic functions\+: {\ttfamily Param} nodes now have {\ttfamily variadic} as a boolean subnode.
\item [\doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 5.\+6] Added support for argument unpacking\+: {\ttfamily Arg} nodes now have {\ttfamily unpack} as a boolean subnode.
\item [\doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 5.\+6] Added support for aliasing of functions and constants. {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Use\+\_\+} nodes now have an integral {\ttfamily type} subnode, which is one of {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Use\+\_\+\+::\+T\+Y\+P\+E\+\_\+\+N\+O\+R\+M\+A\+L} ({\ttfamily use}), {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Use\+\_\+\+::\+T\+Y\+P\+E\+\_\+\+F\+U\+N\+C\+T\+I\+O\+N} ({\ttfamily use function}) or {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}Use\+\_\+\+::\+T\+Y\+P\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+S\+T\+A\+N\+T} ({\ttfamily use const}).

The {\ttfamily Name\+Resolver} now also supports resolution of such aliases.
\item [\doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} 5.\+6] Added support for constant scalar expressions. This means that certain expressions are now allowed as the initializer for constants, properties, parameters, static variables, etc.
\item [B\+C] Improved pretty printing of empty statements lists, which are now printed as {\ttfamily \{\textbackslash{}n\}} instead of {\ttfamily \{\textbackslash{}n \textbackslash{}n\}}. This changes the behavior of the protected {\ttfamily Pretty\+Printer\+Abstract\+::p\+Stmts()} method, so custom pretty printing code making use it of may need to be adjusted.
\item Changed the order of some subnodes to be consistent with their order in the sour code. For example {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}If-\/$>$cond} will now appear before {\ttfamily Stmt\textbackslash{}If-\/$>$stmts} etc.
\item Added {\ttfamily Scalar\textbackslash{}Magic\+Constant-\/$>$get\+Name()}, which returns the name of the magic constant (e.\+g. {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+C\+L\+A\+S\+S\+\_\+\+\_\+}).
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries The following changes are also included in 0.\+9.\+5}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item [B\+C] Deprecated {\ttfamily P\+H\+P\+Parser\+\_\+\+Template} and {\ttfamily P\+H\+P\+Parser\+\_\+\+Template\+Loader}. This functionality does not belong in the main project and -\/ as far as I know -\/ nobody is using it.
\item Add {\ttfamily Node\+Traverser\+::remove\+Visitor()} method, which removes a visitor from the node traverser. This also modifies the corresponding {\ttfamily Node\+Traverser\+Interface}.
\item Fix alias resolution in {\ttfamily Name\+Resolver}\+: Class names are now correctly handled as case-\/insensitive.
\item The undefined variable error, which is used to the lexer to reset the error state, will no longer interfere with custom error handlers.
