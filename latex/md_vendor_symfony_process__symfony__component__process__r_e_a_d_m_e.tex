Process executes commands in sub-\/processes.

In this example, we run a simple directory listing and get the result back\+:

```php use \doxyref{Symfony}{p.}{namespace_symfony};

\$process = new Process(\textquotesingle{}ls -\/lsa\textquotesingle{}); \$process-\/$>$set\+Timeout(3600); \$process-\/$>$run(); if (!\$process-\/$>$is\+Successful()) \{ throw new Runtime\+Exception(\$process-\/$>$get\+Error\+Output()); \}

print \$process-\/$>$get\+Output(); ```

You can think that this is easy to achieve with plain \doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} but it\textquotesingle{}s not especially if you want to take care of the subtle differences between the different platforms.

And if you want to be able to get some feedback in real-\/time, just pass an anonymous function to the {\ttfamily run()} method and you will get the output buffer as it becomes available\+:

```php use \doxyref{Symfony}{p.}{namespace_symfony};

\$process = new Process(\textquotesingle{}ls -\/lsa\textquotesingle{}); \$process-\/$>$run(function (\$type, \$buffer) \{ if (Process\+::\+E\+R\+R === \$type) \{ echo \textquotesingle{}E\+R\+R $>$ \textquotesingle{}.\$buffer; \} else \{ echo \textquotesingle{}O\+U\+T $>$ \textquotesingle{}.\$buffer; \} \}); ```

That\textquotesingle{}s great if you want to execute a long running command (like rsync-\/ing files to a remote server) and give feedback to the user in real-\/time.

You can run the unit tests with the following command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ cd path/to/Symfony/Component/Process/
$ composer install
$ phpunit\end{DoxyVerb}
