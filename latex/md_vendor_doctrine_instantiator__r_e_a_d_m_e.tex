\subsection*{Installation}

The suggested installation method is via {\tt composer}\+:

```sh php composer.\+phar require \char`\"{}doctrine/instantiator\+:$\sim$1.\+0.\+3\char`\"{} ```

\subsection*{Usage}

The instantiator is able to create new instances of any class without using the constructor or any A\+P\+I of the class itself\+:

```php \$instantiator = new ();

\$instance = \$instantiator-\/$>$instantiate(\textquotesingle{}\doxyref{My}{p.}{namespace_my}\textbackslash{}Class\+Name\textbackslash{}Here\textquotesingle{}); ```
