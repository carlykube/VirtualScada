{\bfseries \doxyref{Version}{p.}{namespace_version}} is a library that helps with managing the version number of Git-\/hosted \doxyref{P\+H\+P}{p.}{namespace_p_h_p} projects.

\subsection*{Installation}

Simply add a dependency on {\ttfamily sebastian/version} to your project\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily composer.\+json} file if you use {\tt Composer} to manage the dependencies of your project.

\subsection*{Usage}

The constructor of the {\ttfamily \doxyref{Sebastian\+Bergmann}{p.}{namespace_sebastian_bergmann}\textbackslash{}\doxyref{Version}{p.}{namespace_version}} class expects two parameters\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \$release} is the version number of the latest release ({\ttfamily X.\+Y.\+Z}, for instance) or the name of the release series ({\ttfamily X.\+Y}) when no release has been made from that branch / for that release series yet.
\item {\ttfamily \$path} is the path to the directory (or a subdirectory thereof) where the sourcecode of the project can be found. Simply passing {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\+\_\+\+\_\+} here usually suffices.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Apart from the constructor, the {\ttfamily \doxyref{Sebastian\+Bergmann}{p.}{namespace_sebastian_bergmann}\textbackslash{}\doxyref{Version}{p.}{namespace_version}} class has a single public method\+: {\ttfamily get\+Version()}.

Here is a contrived example that shows the basic usage\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<?php
$version = new SebastianBergmann\Version(
  '3.7.10', '/usr/local/src/phpunit'
);

var_dump($version->getVersion());
?>

string(18) "3.7.10-17-g00f3408"
\end{DoxyVerb}


When a new release is prepared, the string that is passed to the constructor as the first argument needs to be updated.

\subsubsection*{How \doxyref{Sebastian\+Bergmann}{p.}{namespace_sebastian_bergmann}\+::get\+Version() works}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If {\ttfamily \$path} is not (part of) a Git repository and {\ttfamily \$release} is in {\ttfamily X.\+Y.\+Z} format then {\ttfamily \$release} is returned as-\/is.
\item If {\ttfamily \$path} is not (part of) a Git repository and {\ttfamily \$release} is in {\ttfamily X.\+Y} format then {\ttfamily \$release} is returned suffixed with {\ttfamily -\/dev}.
\item If {\ttfamily \$path} is (part of) a Git repository and {\ttfamily \$release} is in {\ttfamily X.\+Y.\+Z} format then the output of {\ttfamily git describe -\/-\/tags} is returned as-\/is.
\item If {\ttfamily \$path} is (part of) a Git repository and {\ttfamily \$release} is in {\ttfamily X.\+Y} format then a string is returned that begins with {\ttfamily X.\+Y} and ends with information from {\ttfamily git describe -\/-\/tags}.
