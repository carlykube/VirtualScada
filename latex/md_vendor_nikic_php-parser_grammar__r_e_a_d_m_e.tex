\section*{.phpy pseudo language }

The {\ttfamily .phpy} file is a normal grammer in {\ttfamily kmyacc} ({\ttfamily yacc}) style, with some transformations applied to it\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Nodes are created using the syntax {\ttfamily Name[..., ...]}. This is transformed into {\ttfamily new Node\textbackslash{}Name(..., ..., \$attributes)}
\item {\ttfamily Name\+::abc} is transformed to {\ttfamily Node\textbackslash{}Name\+::abc}
\item Some function-\/like constructs are resolved (see {\ttfamily \doxyref{rebuild\+Parser.\+php}{p.}{rebuild_parser_8php}} for a list)
\item Associative arrays are written as {\ttfamily [key\+: value, ...]}, which is transformed to `array(\textquotesingle{}key\textquotesingle{} =$>$ value, ...)`
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Building the parser }

In order to rebuild the parser, you need {\tt moriyoshi\textquotesingle{}s fork of kmyacc}. After you compiled/installed it, run the {\ttfamily \doxyref{rebuild\+Parser.\+php}{p.}{rebuild_parser_8php}} script.

By default only the {\ttfamily Parser.\+php} is built. If you want to additionally build {\ttfamily Parser/\+Debug.\+php} and {\ttfamily y.\+output} run the script with {\ttfamily -\/-\/debug}. If you want to retain the preprocessed grammar pass {\ttfamily -\/-\/keep-\/tmp-\/grammar}.
